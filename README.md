# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis & Dashboard Project

## 📊 Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the global impact of COVID-19 using data from the [Johns Hopkins University dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset).  
It covers the full analytics workflow—from raw data cleaning and SQL querying to interactive dashboarding with Power BI.

🔍 **Main Objectives:**
- Track and visualize confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries globally.
- Analyze trends over time and identify regional hotspots.
- Provide a clear, interactive dashboard for data exploration and insight discovery.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python (Pandas):** Data cleaning, transformation, and CSV preparation  
- **MySQL:** Data storage, schema creation, and analytical querying  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and data visualization  
- **Excel:** Preliminary data exploration and validation
